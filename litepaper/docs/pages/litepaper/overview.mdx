# Overview

WeaveDB is the first decentralized, general-purpose modular database protocol that delivers:

- Full Mathematical provability
- Succinct ZK verifiability
- Cloud-grade throughput and latency
- Multi-paradigm support with modular architecture (NoSQL, Relational, Vector, Graph)
- Bit-level-optimised encoding for maximum cost efficiency
- Permanent storage that enables provable data and compute provenance
- Indefinite vertical and horizontal scalability
- Economically self-sustaining operations through DePIN restaking
- Autonomy and self-sovereignty via onchain AI agents

The remainder of this litepaper unpacks each pillar in sequenceâ€”from the monad-based modular architecture, through the WAL-to-HyperBEAM performance pipeline and bit-level cost optimization, to the self-sustainable restaking economics that enable WeaveDB to operate autonomously.
