# Decentralized Log-Structured-Merge Engine

![modular.excalidraw](/images/architecture.png)

WeaveDB is a decentralized, log-structured-merge (LSM) storage engine built on Arweave for permanent storage and the AO Core Protocol for verifiable compute.

Modern databases achieve high performance by using a log-structured storage engine design: writes are first stored in an in-memory memtable, concurrently written to a write-ahead log (WAL), then flushed to SSTables on disk, with periodic compaction for space efficiency.

One of the core bottlenecks in decentralized databases is latency caused by consensus finality. WeaveDB overcomes this by emulating the same log-structured architectureâ€”using a rollup node as the in-memory layer, and HyperBEAM and Arweave as the durable storage layer. This enables low-latency responses while asynchronously finalizing data through TEE-backed validators.
