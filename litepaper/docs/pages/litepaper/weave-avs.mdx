# WeaveAVS

The next phase of WAO development is transforming HyperBEAM into a universal substrate for restaking protocols across multiple blockchainsâ€”including EigenLayer, Karak, and Symbiotic. This will allow any AVS (Actively Validated Service) to inherit the economic security of leading blockchain ecosystems.

HyperAVS will also act as the gateway for WeaveDB to leverage the massive TVL from restaking, providing robust cryptoeconomic security to its decentralized database infrastructure.

This architecture is currently under active research, with the first implementation set to launch soon.
