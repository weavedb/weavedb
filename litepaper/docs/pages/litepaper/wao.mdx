# WAO / HyperBEAM

HyperBEAM is an Erlang implementation of the AO-Core protocol, which makes WeaveDB verifiable from the ground up. WAO is a lightning fast development environment for HyperBEAM and AO, and WeaveDB is heavily integrated and built on top of it.

WAO also turns web browsers into decentralized nodes in mesh networks of AO.
