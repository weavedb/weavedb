# ARJSON

![](./assets/arjson.png)

ARJSON leverages bit-level optimizations to encode JSON at lightning speed while compressing data more efficiently than other self-contained JSON encoding/compression algorithms, such as [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) and [CBOR](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7049).


## How ARJSON Outperforms Every Other Encoding Algorithm

MessagePack generates the smallest encoded data sizes among existing self-contained JSON serialization formats. However, ARJSON outperforms MessagePack in 90% of cases with random data, with the remaining 10% yielding nearly identical sizes. More importantly, for structured data with repetitive patterns and duplicate values, ARJSON far surpasses MessagePack, achieving up to around 95% better compression rates ([20x smaller in size](https://zkjson-v2-benchmark.vercel.app/)).

How could beating the current status quo even be possible at all, let alone by a wide margin?

- **Bit-level optimization over traditional byte-level encoding**  
  MessagePack and other serialization algorithms are optimized at the byte level, often leaving unused bits scattered throughout the encoded data. Since 1 byte consists of 8 bits, data is typically packed into bytes in a way that aligns with standard memory structures. In contrast, ARJSON leverages bit-level optimizations with variable-length data units, ensuring that every bit is utilized efficiently, leaving no space wasted.
  
- **Columnar structure reorganization for enhanced compression**  
 As ARJSON scans JSON data, it dynamically reorganizes it into a columnar structure. Modern databases achieve high performance by storing values of the same field together, which naturally results in sequences of similar data. This structural alignment makes data size more uniform and predictable, increasing redundancy and minimizing differences between neighboring values, ultimately leading to superior compression efficiency.
  
- **Delta packing for efficient storage of sequential and repetitive data**  
  ARJSON leverages its columnar structure to encode differences between consecutive values and efficiently pack repeating sequences. Since meaningful data naturally forms patterns—whether timestamps, counters, or structured records—delta packing takes full advantage of these repetitions, drastically reducing storage and improving compression efficiency.
  
- **Simple, Deterministic, and Metadata-Efficient**  
  Despite its advanced compression capabilities, ARJSON is based on simple deterministic principles. With just a single scan, it dynamically applies bit-level optimizations, columnar reorganization, and delta packing without requiring multiple passes or complex heuristics. The deterministic order eliminates the need for unnecessary metadata, further reducing storage overhead and ensuring a compact and streamlined encoding process.
  
- **Absolute Minimum Incremental Only Upgrade of Immutable Data**  
  ARJSON is purpose-built for efficient, permanent data upgrades. It enables absolute minimum, incremental bit-level updates to immutable data, making it ideal for frequently updated permanent databases. Instead of rewriting entire documents, ARJSON allows compact, append-only mutations that preserve historical integrity while minimizing storage costs.

## Bit Level Optimization

[LEB128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) is a byte-level optimized integer encoding scheme that represents base-128 numbers using 7-bit chunks per byte. The most significant bit (MSB) serves as a continuation flag, indicating whether additional bytes are needed to fully encode the number. This allows efficient storage of variable-length integers while minimizing wasted space.

For instance,

- 3 : `00000011`
- 120 : `01111000`
- 150 : `10010110 00000001` = 22 (`00010110`) + 128 * 10 ** 1 (`00000001`)

However, small numbers in LEB128 waste bits. 3 requires only 2 bits (`11`) but consumes 8 bits in LEB128.

ARJSON eliminates wasted bits by introducing a 2-bit flag to specify the number encoding scheme, followed by the minimal bit representation required for the number:

- `00` : 2 bit integer
- `01` : 3 bit integer
- `10` : 4 bit integer
- `11` : LEB128

For instance, `3` is stored as `0011` (flag: `00`, integer: `11`), using only 4 bits — a 50% reduction compared to LEB128.

If you store 1,000 numbers, ARJSON saves 4 bits per number, resulting in 5,000 bits (500 bytes) of storage savings—a significant improvement in compression efficiency.

Additionally, ARJSON adapts its integer encoding based on context, using three optimized schemes:

- **Short**
  - `00` : 2 bit integer
  - `01` : 3 bit integer
  - `10` : 4 bit integer
  - `11` : LEB128

- **Uint**
  - `00` : 3 bit integer
  - `01` : 4 bit integer
  - `10` : 6 bit integer
  - `11` : LEB128

- **LEB128**
  - no flags requried

This adaptive approach ensures minimal storage overhead while maintaining fast encoding and decoding speeds.

For integers with a known maximum length, ARJSON eliminates the need for additional flags. For example, since ARJSON defines only 8 value types, each type can be represented within 3 bits. In such cases, the 2-bit flag is omitted, and a 3-bit integer encoding is used instead.

This saves 2 bits per number, leading to a total 5-bit reduction compared to LEB128’s minimum 8-bit representation.

Additionally, ARJSON performs a single scan over the data, restructuring it into a columnar format in a deterministic order. This approach eliminates the need for explicit markers or metadata, as bit positions inherently define what each number represents.

## Columnar Restructuring

ARJSON converts JSON data into integer representations and organizes them into column-based chunks during scanning. The encoded data is divided into 13 groups of similar integers, ensuring that related values are packed together. The packing order is crucial, as earlier groups act as metadata for subsequent groups.

### 1. First Bit

The very first bit classifies whether the data is a primitive type including an empty array (`[]`) and an object (`{}`), or a no-empty array or an object. Since primitive types require no additional structural metadata, they follow a separate optimized encoding path, often requiring just 1 byte.
  - `0` : a non-empty structured object
  - `1` : a primitive value or an empty array or an empty object

### 2. Value Count

If the first bit is `0`, the following bits represent the number (short) of values in the JSON.

### 3. Value Flags

ARJSON builds a structure map, linking values to keys and keys to their parent objects, while also marking objects and arrays. For instance, with `{ a: 1, b: 2, c: [3, 4] }`, it first discovers an object `{}` then goes through `a` => `1` => `b` => `2` => `c` => `[]` => `3` => `4`, which generates a keymap of `[ -1, 0, 0, 0, 3 ]` and a value map of `[ 1, 2, 4, 4 ]`. The keymap corresponds to `[ "{}", "a", "b", "c", "[]" ]` and the value map correcponds to `[ 1, 2, 4, 4 ]` respectively. The valuemap is converted to deltas if the difference is less than 4, which usually gives us small integers saving bits. So `[ 1, 2, 4, 4 ]` becomes `[ 1, 1, 2, 0 ]`. If a delta decreases, an offset of 4 is added to indicate a negative shift.

- `[ 1, 2, 4, 4 ]` => `[ 1, 1, 2, 0 ]`
- `[ 1, 2, 4, 2 ]` => `[ 1, 1, 2, -2 ]` => `[ 1, 1, 2, 6 ]`
- `[ 1, 2, 4, 10 ]` => `[ 1, 1, 2, 10 ]`

Value flags are 1 bit flags to specify if the corresponding item is a delta (`1`) or non-delta (`0`).

- `[ 1, 1, 2, 0 ]` => `1111` (all delta)
- `[ 1, 1, 2, 6 ]` => `1111` (all delta)
- `[ 1, 1, 2, 10 ]` => `1110` (delta except for `10`)

For delta-encoded values, ARJSON uses only 3 bits per number (range 0-8), saving multiple bits compared to non-delta values.

### 4. Value Links

Value links represent the value map (`[ 1, 1, 2, 0 ]`), with each integer’s bit-length deterministically determined by combining the value map with the key map. For example, given the key map `[ -1(0), 0(1), 0(2), 0(3), 3(4) ]` and the value map `[ 1(v), 2(v), 4(v), 4(v) ]`, preserving the scanning order results in `[ -1(0), 0(1), 1(v), 0(2), 2(v), 0(3), 3(4), 4(v), 4(v) ]`. Since key indexes are always incremental, `1(v)` can only refer to previous indexes, ensuring it is safe to encode using only 2 bits. However, since `0` is reserved for bit increment, ARJSON increments non-delta values by 1 before encoding, so `[ 1, 2, 4, 4 ]` becomes `[ 2, 3, 5, 5 ]`, and `2(v)` actually consumes 3 bits while remaining fully deterministic. Delta values always consume only 3 bits.

`0` with the current expected number of bits is used to indicate increments in the number of bits required for each link. For example, in the value map `[ 1, 2, 2, 7, 15 ]` (40 bits), it becomes `[ 1, 0, 0, 7, 15 ]` with delta conversion and the required bit lengths are `[ 3(delta), 3(delta), 3(delta), 3, 4 ]`. To encode this efficiently, ARJSON inserts `0` before each increment except for deltas as we always know a delta requires 3 bits, resulting in 22 bits, saving 18 bits.

- `001(delta) 000(delta) 000(delta) 0(inc) 00(inc) 111(7) 000(inc) 1111(15)`

This ensures that ARJSON can always determine the minimum number of bits needed to read the next value link without additional metadata.

#### Delta Packing

If the same delta pattern occurs more than three times consecutively, ARJSON applies delta packing to eliminate redundant storage. For example, with the value map `[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]`, delta conversion results in `[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]`, requiring 27 bits (3 bits per value). Instead of storing repetitive deltas, ARJSON compresses the sequence by indicating delta packing with `0` (3 bits), specifying the length `9` (4 bits), and encoding the delta value `1` (3 bits), resulting in just 10 bits (`000 1001 001`). This saves 17 bits compared to the naive approach.

### 5.Key Flags

Key flags are 1-bit indicators that specify whether a key uses delta encoding, just like value flags.

### 6. Key Links

Key links represent the keymap (`[ -1, 0, 0, 0, 3 ]`), but since the first element is always `-1`, it is removed. Additionally, `0` is reserved for delta packing, so `[ -1, 0, 0, 0, 3 ]` is transformed into `[ 1, 1, 1, 4 ]`, with delta conversion and packing further optimizing it to `[ 1, 0, 0, 3 ]`.

### 7. Key Types

Key types are 2-bit indicators that define the type of each key in the keymap:

- `00` (0) : array
- `01` (1) : object
- `10` (2) : base64url string key
- `11` (3) : string key

For example, given the key map `["{}", "a", "b", "c", "[]"]`, the key types would be `[1, 3, 3, 3, 0]`. `base64url` keys save at least 2 bits per character since they are converted to numbers less than 64 and encoded in just 6 bits each, whereas regular string keys are stored using LEB128. This optimization applies only to keys consisting solely of base64url characters (alphanumeric, `-`, and `_`).

For keys classified as base64url or regular strings (types `2` and `3`), key types are followed by the string length in a compressed format. For example, the key `abc` is stored as `10 00 11` (`10` for base64url, `00` indicating a 2-bit short encoding, and `11` representing a length of 3).

Key types are followed by a key length (short) + 1 (since `0` is reserved for duplicate references) if the key type is string (`10` or `11`). For instance, if the key is `abc`, the key type is `10 00 11`.

Duplicate string keys and types are replaced with a `0` flag followed by a deterministic index, significantly reducing storage overhead. For instance, in `[ { "name": "Bob" }, { "name": "Alice" } ]`, the second occurrence of `name` is not stored as `base64url` again but instead referenced with `10 000`, pointing to the first occurrence, saving 22 bits (`name` vs `0`, 24 bits vs 2 bits). This method extends to cross-referencing values as well. In `[ { "name": "Bob" }, { "Bob": "name" } ]`, both `name` and `Bob` are replaced with deterministic indexes `0` and `1`, respectively, further reducing redundancy.

### 8. Keys

Keys are either `base64url` strings or regular strings. As explained earlier, duplicate keys are replaced with deterministic indexes, significantly reducing redundancy and saving bits.

### 9. Data Types

ARJSON defines 7 data types, each represented using only 3 bits:

- `001` (1) : `null`
- `010` (2) : `base64url string`
- `011` (3) : `bool`
- `100` (4) : `positive integer`
- `101` (5) : `negative integer`
- `110` (6) : `float`
- `111` (7) : `string`

The value `0` is reserved for type packing. If the same type appears more than three times consecutively, it is compressed using a repeat flag (`0`), a short-length encoding, and the actual type. For example, `[ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 ]` is compressed into `[ 0, 5, 3 ]`, which is stored as `000 101 011`, saving 6 bits.

### 10. Boolean Values

Boolean values are stored in 1 bit:

- `0` : false
- `1` : true

### 11. Number Values

Positive and negative integers are stored using a 2-bit flag in a custom number system:

- `00` (0) : delta
- `01` (1) : 4 bits
- `10` (2) : 6 bits
- `11` (3) : LEB128

If a value is delta-encoded (`0` flag), and the next bit is `7`, it indicates delta packing, followed by a short length and a 3-bit delta value. For example, `[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]` (30 bits) is first transformed into `[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ]` via delta conversion, then further compressed to `00 111 001` using delta packing, saving 22 bits.

Floats are handled differently, using a sign, precision, and integer representation. The first integer combines the sign and precision, adding 4 to the precision when the number is negative. If the precision is greater than 2, the first integer stores `0` for positive numbers and `4` for negative numbers, while the second integer holds the actual precision. The last integer is always the numerical value itself.

For example, `-3.14` is a negative number with precision `2`, which makes the first integer `6` (2 + 4) and the second integer `314` in LEB128 format. So `-3.14` results in `01 0110 11 10011010 00000010` which is 24 bits (3 bytes). In contrast, MessagePack consumes 9 bytes to store `-3.14`.

### 12. String Values

String values follow the same compression rules as keys but are stored in value positions rather than key positions. For example, in `{ "name": "Bob" }`, `name` is encoded as a key, while `Bob` is stored separately as a string value.

### 13. Padding

To ensure proper byte alignment, the encoded bitstream is zero-padded to the nearest multiple of 8 bits. If the encoded data is 29 bits, ARJSON adds three padding bits to extend it to 32 bits (4 bytes), maintaining efficient byte-level storage.

## Special Optimization for Primitive Values and Empty Objects

When the first bit is `1`, ARJSON applies special encoding rules using the next 7 bits, which differ from those used for structured objects. These optimizations allow primitive values and empty objects to be stored with minimal overhead, ensuring maximum compression efficiency.

  - `0` : other value types
    - `00000` (0) : `null` (`00000000`)
	- `00001` (1) : `true` (`00000001`)	
	- `00010` (2)  : `false` (`00000010`)
	- `00011` (3) : `""` (`00000011`)
	- `00100` (4) : `[]` (`00000100`)
	- `00101` (5) : `{}` (`00000101`)	  
	- `00110` (6) : negative integer followed by `uint` (-1 => `00000110 001`)
	- `00111` (7) : positive float followed by `uint` (precision) and `uint` (integer)  
	(3.14 = > `00000111 00010111 01110100 00000010`)
	- `01000` (8) : negative float followed by `uint` (precision) and `uint` (integer)  
	(-3.14 = > `00001000 00010111 01110100 00000010`)
	- `01001` - `111100` (9-60) : alphabetical single character (charmap + 9)
	- `111101` (61) : non-alphabetical single character : followed by LEB128 (charcode)
	- `111110` (62) : alphabetical multi characters : followed by short (charmap)
    - `111111` (63) : non-alphabetic multi characters : followed by LEB128 (charcode)
  - `1` : positive integer : followed by either
    - 6 bit interger if smaller than or equal to 63 (62 => `01111110`)
	-  or `111111` and LEB128 if bigger than 63 (70 => 63 + 7 => `01111111 00000111`)
  
```js
const charmap = { 
  A: 0, B: 1, C: 2, D: 3, E: 4, F: 5, G: 6, H: 7, I: 8,
  J: 9, K: 10, L: 11, M: 12, N: 13, O: 14, P: 15, Q: 16, R: 17,
  S: 18, T: 19, U: 20, V: 21, W: 22, X: 23, Y: 24, Z: 25,
  a: 26, b: 27, c: 28, d: 29, e: 30, f: 31, g: 32, h: 33, i: 34,
  j: 35, k: 36, l: 37, m: 38, n: 39, o: 40, p: 41, q: 42, r: 43,
  s: 44, t: 45, u: 46, v: 47, w: 48, x: 49, y: 50, z: 51
}
```
With these special rules, positive integers less than 64 and single alphhabetical characters, as well as `null`, `true`, `false` `""`, `[]`, `{}`, are all encoded in just 1 byte, maximizing efficiency while minimizing storage overhead.
