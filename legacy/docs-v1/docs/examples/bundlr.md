# Large Data Upload with Bundlr

When you have large pieces of data such as images or blog entries, you wouldn't want to store them to WeaveDB. But you would store them directory in Arweave Storage and store a tiny piece of metadata (transaction ID) to WeaveDB to link to them.

WeaveDB with Arweave Storage is equivalent to Firestore with Cloud Storage, or DynamoDB with S3 storage. You can use a relayer to securely store large data and bind them with WeaveDB indexes.

For this example, we will build a simple markdown note taking dapp where you can publish notes through [Bundlr](https://bundlr.network/) with a WeaveDB relayer.

![](/img/relayer-bundlr-1.png)

1. A relayer job can be preset on the WeaveDB instance with `jobId`, `allowed_relayers`, `extra data schema`. All the conditions must be met before relayed queries go through.
2. The data owner signs metadata to attach to the `note` and sends the `signed query` and the `note` to the relayer.
3. The relayer uploads the `note` to Arweave using Bundlr and gets the `tx.id` for it, attaches the `tx.id` as an extra piece of data, then signs it with eip712, then sends the transaction to the WeaveDB contract on Warp.
4. The WeaveDB contract verifies the eip712 signatures and validates `jobID`, `allowed relayers` and `extra data schema`.
5. The initial query data can be modified with access control rules on the collection. We will check if the `signer` is the data `owner`, and add the `owner` and `tx.id` to the original data.
6. To access the `note`, the frontend dapp can first get the metadata from WeaveDB and use the `tx.id` to fetch the `note` at `arweave.net/[tx.id]`.

In practice, you would use a verifiable relayer with the [Lit Protocol integration](/docs/sdk/relayers#verifiable-oracles-with-lit-protocol) for more security.

You can also encrypt the notes using [Lit Access Conditions](/docs/examples/lit-protocol).

A demo dapp is deployed at [relayer-bundlr.vercel.app](https://relayer-bundlr.vercel.app).

## Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weavedb/weavedb.git
cd weavedb
yarn
```

## Deploy WeaveDB Contracts

```bash
node scripts/generate-wallet.js mainnet
yarn deploy
```
Or you could follow [this tutorial](/docs/examples/todos-console) and use the [Web Console](https://console.weavedb.dev).

Now you should receive `contractTxId` for the deployed contract.

## Configure DB Instance

We will show you one command script to set up everything in the end, but these are what needs to be set up.

### Set up Data Schema

We are going to set up only 1 collection.

- `notes` : a collection of notes

```js
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  required: ["date", "id", "author", "title"],
  properties: {
    title: {
      type: "string",
    },
    date: {
      type: "number",
    },
    id: {
      type: "string",
    },
    author: {
      type: "string",
    },
  },
}
await sdk.setSchema(schema, "notes", { ar: wallet })
```

- `date` : published date
- `id` : Arweave Transaction ID
- `author` : author of the note
- `title` : title of the note

### Set up Relayer Job

Set a simple relayer job.

- `relayerAddress` : an EVM address of the relayer to sign and relay WeaveDB queries.
- `schema` : JSON schema for the additional data to be attached by the relayer. The relayer will attach 3 pieces of extra data, `date`, `id`, and `author`.
- `jobID` : our arbitrary jobID will be `bundlr`.

```js
const job = {
  relayers: [relayerAddress],
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    required: ["date", "id", "author"],
    properties: {
      date: {
        type: "number",
      },
      id: {
        type: "string",
      },
      author: {
        type: "string",
      },
    },
  },
}

await sdk.addRelayerJob("bundlr, job, { ar: wallet })
```
With these simple settings, we expect the relayer to receive the `author`, `title`, and body content before adding the `date` and uploading it to bundlr.

Finally, it relays the signed WeaveDB query with extra data of (`author`, `date`, `id`) to the signed query.

### Set up Access Control Rules

```js
const rules = {
  "let create,update": {
    "resource.newData.author": { var: "request.auth.extra.author" },
    "resource.newData.date": { var: "request.auth.extra.date" },
    "resource.newData.id": { var: "request.auth.extra.id" },
  },
  "allow create": {
    "==": [{ var: "request.auth.signer" }, { var: "resource.newData.author" }],
  },
  "allow update,delete": {
    "==": [{ var: "request.auth.signer" }, { var: "resource.data.author" }],
  },
}

await sdk.setRules(rules, "notes", { ar: wallet })
```

`let create,update` will copy `author`, `date`, `id` from the relayer extra data when a note is being created or updated.

`allow create` will check if the `signer` is the `author` of the new note.

`allow update,delete` will check if the `signer` is the `author` of the existing note.

### Set up Everything with Script

To set up everything with one command, run the following.

```bash
node scripts/bundlr-setup.js mainnet YOUR_CONTRACT_TX_ID RELAYER_EVM_ADDRESS
```

## Set up Local gRPC Node

For a better performance for the relayer, you would want to set up a local grpc node.

Follow [this tutorial](/docs/examples/relayer-nft#set-up-local-grpc-node) to do so.

## Set up Bundlr

The relayer needs to upload notes to Bundlr and add the `tx.id` to the signed query.

To set up Bundlr, you could also follow [this tutorial](https://docs.bundlr.network/category/basic-features) in their official docs.

Bundlr let you use many tokens from other blockchains to pay GAS for the Arweave storage.

For this example, we will fund our account with `$MATIC` on Polygon.

### Install Bundlr SDK

```bash
yarn add @bundlr-network/client
```

### Fund a Node

You need to add some credit to the account for the relayer.

```js
import Bundlr from "@bundlr-network/client";
const privateKey = "yourpolygonprivatekey";

const bundlr = new Bundlr.default("http://node1.bundlr.network", "matic", privateKey);

let response = await bundlr.fund(price);

// Get loaded balance in atomic units
let atomicBalance = await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();
console.log(`node balance (atomic units) = ${atomicBalance}`);

// Convert balance to an easier to read format
let convertedBalance = bundlr.utils.unitConverter(atomicBalance);
console.log(`node balance (converted) = ${convertedBalance}`);
```
## NextJS Frontend Dapp

### Set up Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` file and set the following variables.

```
WEAVEDB_RPC_NODE="localhost:8080"
BUNDLR_PRIVATEKEY="Bundlr_EOA_Privatekey"
RELAYER_PRIVATEKEY="Relayer_EOA_Privatekey"

NEXT_PUBLIC_WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID="Your_Contract_Tx_Id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEAVEDB_RPC_WEB="http://localhost:8080"
```

### Set up Relayer

We will set up the relayer as NextJS serverless api located at `/pages/api/bundlr`.

The relayer

- constructs a `note` object
- uploads it to Bundlr
- adds extra data of `{ id, author, date }` to the user signed params
- and relays the query to WeaveDB.

```js
const Bundlr = require("@bundlr-network/client")
const contractTxId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WEAVEDB_CONTRACT_TX_ID
const { isNil } = require("ramda")
const SDK = require("weavedb-node-client")

export default async (req, res) => {
  const { body, params } = JSON.parse(req.body)
  const bundlr = new Bundlr.default(
    "http://node1.bundlr.network",
    "matic",
	process.env.BUNDLR_PRIVATEKEY
  )
  const note = {
    title: params.query[0].title,
    body,
    author: params.caller,
    date: Date.now(),
  }
  const tags = [
    { name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" },
    { name: "appName", value: "weavedb-bundlr-test" },
  ]
  let error = null
  let success = false
  let relay_tx = null
  try {
    const bundlr_tx = await bundlr.upload(JSON.stringify(note), { tags })
    if (!isNil(bundlr_tx.id)) {
      const sdk = new SDK({
        contractTxId,
        rpc: process.env.WEAVEDB_RPC_NODE,
      })
      relay_tx = await sdk.relay(
        params.jobID,
        params,
        { id: bundlr_tx.id, author: note.author, date: note.date },
        {
          jobID: params.jobID,
          privateKey: process.env.RELAYER_PRIVATEKEY,
        }
      )
      if (relay_tx.success) {
        success = true
      } else {
        error = relay_tx.error
      }
    } else {
      error = relay_tx
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e)
    error = e
  }
  res.status(200).json({ success, error, tx: relay_tx })
}
```

### Frontend Page

This is how you would get a note in the frontend code.

```js
// getting 5 notes of the account in descending order by published date
const notes = await db.get("notes", ["author", "==", account], ["date", "desc"], 5)

// fetching the body of the first note
const note = await fetch(`https://arweave.net/${notes[0].id}`).then(v => v.json())
```

The rest of the frontend code will be omitted as it's not the primary focus of this tutorial. You can access the entire code [here](https://github.com/weavedb/weavedb/tree/master/examples/relayer-bundlr).
