# About WeaveDB

## What WeaveDB Is

WeaveDB is a NoSQL database powered by [Warp Contracts](https://warp.cc/) on the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) blockchain.

While web3 dapps may use decentralized technologies like blockchain to facilitate trust and transparency, they may still rely on centralized components like databases for storing data. This can lead to a certain level of centralization, as these components are often controlled by a single entity or organization.

WeaveDB is addressing this issue by offering a decentralized database layer that is not only scalable but also free to use and faster than many traditional web2 solutions.

## How WeaveDB Works

WeaveDB is a decentralized database system that uses the Arweave network as its underlying storage layer. It is designed to offer a scalable, secure, and fast solution for data storage.

It also provides instant finality where transaction fees can be paid in advance with tokens from different chains thanks to [Bundlr](https://bundlr.network/).

Each WeaveDB database instance is a [Warp](https://warp.cc/) smart contract on the Arweave blockchain.

Overall, WeaveDB operates using a hybrid architecture that brings the benefits of traditional centralized databases to the web3 space in a decentralized manner.

## Why WeaveDB

WeaveDB offers several advantages over traditional web2 solutions:

- **Fast query performance**: The query performance is often faster than web2 solutions.
- **Cheap permanent storage**: Data is stored on [Arweave](https://arweave.org).
- **Prepaid gas fees**: With [Bundlr](https://bundlr.network/), developer can cover gas fees upfront.
- **Cross-chain crypto authentication**: WeaveDB supports authentication using any EVM-based, DFINITY, and ArConnect wallets.
- **Decentralized APIs**: APIs similar to [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) but completely decentralized.
- **Cross-chain data bridges**: Allowing developers to easily import their data from different blockchain networks and even web2 APIs.
- **Data encryption**: You can use Lit protocol to encrypt data, ensuring data privacy and security.
- **Scalability**: WeaveDB is virtually infinitely scalable, making it ideal for large-scale decentralized applications.
- **Built-in decentralized indexer**: Making it easy to search and query large datasets without relying on a centralzied indexer.
- **Scheduled tasks**: Allowing developers to execute actions on-chain at specified times.
