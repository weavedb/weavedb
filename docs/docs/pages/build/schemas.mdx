# Data Schemas

It's essential to set a precise data schema and access controls to each collection as otherwise WeaveDB is permissionless and anyone can put arbitrary data.

To validate write data, WeaveDB uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) with a restriction that you cannot pass valiator functions.

Set a schema to a collection.

```js
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  required: ["id", "actor", "content", "published", "likes"],
  properties: {
    id: { type: "string" },
    actor: { type: "string", pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{43}$" },
    content: { type: "string", minLength: 1, maxLength: 140 },
    published: { type: "integer" },
    likes: { type: "integer" },
  },
  additionalProperties: false,
}
await db.setSchema(schema, "notes")
```

Get the schema of a collection.

```js
const schema = (await db.stat("notes")).schema
```
