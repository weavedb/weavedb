# WDB64 Timestamp

## Overview
WDB64 is a **deterministic timestamp system** that generates unique 64-bit timestamps for WeaveDB transactions. It ensures every document has a distinct timestamp by combining millisecond precision with transaction counting, eliminating sorting ambiguity in concurrent operations.

## The Problem
WeaveDB applications face timestamp challenges:
* **Duplicate timestamps** when multiple transactions occur in the same millisecond
* **Ambiguous sorting** when documents share identical timestamps
* **Ordering conflicts** in high-throughput scenarios
* **Lost precision** in timestamp-based indexing

## The Solution: WDB64

WDB64 creates **guaranteed unique timestamps** by encoding microsecond-level precision:

```
64 bits = Milliseconds × 1000 + Transaction Counter
```

This ensures:
- ✅ **No duplicate timestamps** even in burst operations
- ✅ **Deterministic ordering** for all documents
- ✅ **Microsecond precision** while maintaining compatibility
