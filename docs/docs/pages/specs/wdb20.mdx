# WDB20 Fungible Token

WDB20 is a **database-native fungible token standard** that brings ERC20-like functionality directly into WeaveDB and other database systems. Unlike traditional blockchain tokens, WDB20 tokens exist as structured data within databases, enabling seamless integration with database operations while maintaining the familiar fungible token interface.
