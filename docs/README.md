## What is WeaveDB?

WeaveDB is a NoSQL database powered by [Warp Contracts](https://warp.cc/) (SmartWeave) on the [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/) blockchain.

The query APIs are similar to [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) from Google but completely decentralized.

#### Web3 Dapps with Web2 UX

Smart contract transactions are auto-signed, free and instant for dapp users, which enables web2 like smooth UX for fully decentralized web3 dapps.

#### Crypto Authentication

WeaveDB is permissionless with granular access controls with pure cryptography. Anyone can access with a one-time Metamask signature.

#### Powerful Logic for Complex Dapps

WeaveDB allows JSON-based functional programming on data, which opens up possibilities for building highly complex dapps with ease.

## Contract Versions

## Demo Dapps

*WeaveDB is still in its infancy. Everything is subject to change.*
